I made this website for a Harvard course and don't have the work ethic to finish it, tbh. I will at some point, though. Perhaps.
<br>But this is something for now, at least, I guess. I mean, it fits the criteria =P

<em><br>"Weâ€™ll leave its design largely up to you, subject only to the following requirements:

i) Your website's main page should live in index.html, since most web servers serve up index.html by default, in the absence of an explicit file name in a URL.
<br>ii) Your website must include a least one other page (with any filename, so long as it ends in .html), and your website's main page (i.e., index.html) must somehow link to that page. You can click "Add File" icon at the top of the embedded file browser to add a new file to your "repl".
<br>iii) Your website must include at least one image. Note that the embedded file browser also has a mechanism for uploading files from your computer, though you may also use images already on the internet.
<br>iv) Your website must be stylized with at least several CSS properties, which must live in styles.css (an "external stylesheet"), just as we saw (briefly) in css4.html. Your CSS needs to ultimately end up connected to your HTML, as well.
<br>v) Your website should be more complex than those from class (but much less complex than Harvard's home page!). As such, your website should probably use a few dozen HTML tags overall, plus several CSS properties."</em>

<br>This is my 4th website ever, and 1st proper one with multiple pages :p
